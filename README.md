# Description 

Do you want to use Alpine to easily run graphical applications, transfer data, and submit jobs, all from your 
browser? Open OnDemand is a browser based interactive tool that provides access to CU Research Computing (CURC) 
resources (such as Alpine and Blanca). It is the primary method that allows institutions in RMACC to access CURC 
resources and is also extremely useful for any individual who is new to High Performance Computing systems.

In this RC Primer* course, we will cover logging in, performing small data transfers, accessing a login node, and 
starting interactive applications (such as Jupyter) all via Open OnDemand. Additionally, we will demonstrate how to 
use common graphical applications, such as Jupyter Notebooks and RStudio.

\* What is an RC Primer?: An RC Primer is a session that provide an introduction to concepts, systems, and tools. 
You can expect to leave "Primers" with an introductory-level understanding of the topic.
